# EstateRegister
Another university assignment.

Javadoc hosted by Jitpack [here](https://javadoc.jitpack.io/no/iskra/EstateRegister/master-SNAPSHOT/javadoc/joakilan/oppg11/package-summary.html)

Build with 'gradle jar' task.

The really useful part of this app is the CLI, which I've split out as a separate library [here](https://github.com/jlangvand/CLI-Tool).
